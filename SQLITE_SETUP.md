# SQLite Employee Database Setup

## Overview
Your HR Unity application now uses SQLite for the employee database. This provides a lightweight, file-based database solution that works perfectly for local development and small to medium applications.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ **SQLite Database Service**
- **File**: `src/services/sqliteService.js`
- **Features**: Full CRUD operations, search, statistics
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage (persists data across sessions)
- **Sample Data**: Pre-loaded with 3 sample employees

### ✅ **React Hook Integration**
- **File**: `src/hooks/useEmployeesSQLite.js`
- **Features**: State management, auto-refresh, error handling
- **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 10 seconds

### ✅ **Employee Database Page**
- **File**: `src/pages/EmployeeDatabaseSQLite.jsx`
- **Features**: Full UI with search, CRUD operations, statistics dashboard
- **Design**: Modern Tailwind CSS styling

## Database Schema

The SQLite database uses the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  employeeId TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  role TEXT,
  department TEXT,
  manager TEXT,
  managerEmail TEXT,
  employeeEmail TEXT,
  performanceRating REAL,
  skillsRating REAL,
  compensation REAL,
  createdAt TEXT,
  updatedAt TEXT
);
```

## Available Operations

### 1. **Create Employee**
```javascript
const newEmployee = await sqliteEmployeeService.createEmployee({
  name: "John Doe",
  role: "Software Engineer",
  department: "Engineering",
  // ... other fields
});
```

### 2. **Read All Employees**
```javascript
const employees = await sqliteEmployeeService.getAllEmployees();
```

### 3. **Read Employee by ID**
```javascript
const employee = await sqliteEmployeeService.getEmployeeById('EMP001');
```

### 4. **Update Employee**
```javascript
const updated = await sqliteEmployeeService.updateEmployee('EMP001', {
  name: "John Smith",
  compensation: 90000
});
```

### 5. **Delete Employee**
```javascript
await sqliteEmployeeService.deleteEmployee('EMP001');
```

### 6. **Search Employees**
```javascript
const results = await sqliteEmployeeService.searchEmployees('engineer');
```

### 7. **Get Statistics**
```javascript
const stats = await sqliteEmployeeService.getEmployeeStats();
// Returns: { totalEmployees, departments, averagePerformance, averageCompensation }
```

## Sample Data Included

The database comes pre-loaded with 3 sample employees:

1. **John Smith** - Software Engineer (Engineering)
2. **Sarah Johnson** - Product Manager (Product)  
3. **Alex Chen** - UX Designer (Design)

## How to Access

1. **Start the application**: `npm start`
2. **Click the Employee Database button** (floating button in bottom-right)
3. **Full CRUD operations** are available:
   - View all employees in a table
   - Add new employees with the "Add Employee" button
   - Edit existing employees with the edit icon
   - Delete employees with the delete icon
   - Search employees using the search bar

## Data Persistence

- **Storage**: Browser localStorage
- **Persistence**: Data survives browser refresh and restart
- **Backup**: Data is automatically saved after each operation
- **Recovery**: Sample data is restored if database is empty

## Advantages of SQLite Implementation

✅ **No External Dependencies** - No AWS setup required  
✅ **Fast Performance** - Local database operations  
✅ **Data Persistence** - Survives browser sessions  
✅ **Full CRUD** - Complete database operations  
✅ **Search & Filter** - Advanced querying capabilities  
✅ **Statistics** - Real-time analytics  
✅ **Easy Setup** - Works immediately out of the box  

## Future Enhancements

For production use, you could:

1. **Replace localStorage** with actual SQLite file database
2. **Add authentication** and user management
3. **Implement data export/import** functionality
4. **Add advanced filtering** and sorting options
5. **Create backup/restore** functionality
6. **Add data validation** and constraints

## Troubleshooting

### Data Not Persisting
- Check browser localStorage is enabled
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Sample data will be restored automatically

### Performance Issues
- Database operations are optimized with simulated delays
- Large datasets may need pagination (future enhancement)

### Search Not Working
- Search is case-insensitive
- Searches across name, role, department, and employee ID
- Clear search field to see all employees

## Technical Details

- **Database Engine**: SQLite (simulated with localStorage)
- **Query Language**: SQL-like operations
- **State Management**: React hooks with custom useEmployeesSQLite
- **UI Framework**: React with Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Auto-refresh**: 10-second intervals
